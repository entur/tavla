# Releases
## v6.3.0
# Share locked boards between user for collaboration\r\n\r\nThis release brings shared boards to Entur-Tavla! With this feature, you can share your locked boards with other for easier management and collaboration. This is great for hotels and other institutions where several people should have access to update and edit a board while still having the board locked to prevent unauthorised alterations.\r\n\r\nSharing happens through the «Deling»-tab of a board's settings. Here, all owners will have access to invite users, as well as remove pending invites and current owners. Those receiving an invite can either accept or decline it under «Mine tavler» --> «Invitasjoner». \r\n\r\nAll invite and owner information under «Deling» and «Invitasjoner» updates live and let's you keep track of your boards current state without having to refresh the page. \r\n\r\n## Demo \r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22789935/144822836-484e23f2-1fe2-4344-9523-e2091ff582cb.mov\r\n\r\nIn addition to shared boards, the release also includes several fixes and package updates.

# Live vehicle positions in map\r\nThis release introduces live positions for vehicles in an array of cities throughout Norway. At the time of writing mainly busses and trams provide live data. To turn the feature on, head over to \"rediger\" when you are on your board, and toggle \"sanntidsposisjoner\". From here you can select which lines to display live in your map. To see more details you can hover over a vehicle. \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32391231/137276222-fecd1ca0-d0d0-4b7c-a87b-f3f5b95f6bcb.png)\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* Sanntidsposisjoner by @Collatty in https://github.com/entur/tavla/pull/474\r\n* Readable tooltip for dark theme by @Collatty in https://github.com/entur/tavla/pull/477\r\n* Make functionality for hiding menu on scroll work as intended by @magnusrand in https://github.com/entur/tavla/pull/478\r\n* Enforce import grouping, react first, siblings last by @draperunner in https://github.com/entur/tavla/pull/479\r\n* Skjule sanntidsdata vha innstillinger by @Collatty in https://github.com/entur/tavla/pull/480\r\n* Fix manifest invalid src error by @Collatty in https://github.com/entur/tavla/pull/481\r\n* Fikse \"can't read x of undefined\" error by @Collatty in https://github.com/entur/tavla/pull/482\r\n* Update forms by @magnusrand in https://github.com/entur/tavla/pull/483\r\n* Live data by @Collatty in https://github.com/entur/tavla/pull/484\r\n* Line route overlay by @Collatty in https://github.com/entur/tavla/pull/487\r\n* Fix permissions-policy header by @Collatty in https://github.com/entur/tavla/pull/488\r\n\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/entur/tavla/compare/v6.1.0...v6.2.0

## v6.0.0
# Custom URLs, Bolt scooters in map, EnTur SDK integration, package upgrades and fixes\r\n### Custom URLs\r\nWhen editing a board by clicking «Rediger», there is now a new editing option available under the tab «Endre lenke». This option lets you set a custom URL for your board, e.g. `tavla.entur.no/t/my_custom_board`. The tab is showcased below:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2021-09-02 at 14 23 17](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22789935/131843157-c599cf9e-9598-4e72-b6b4-b27f1860f97c.png)\r\n\r\n### Bolt scooters in map\r\nThe new EnTur-SDK provides a new type of scooter for the map. Bolt is now visible if the map and «Sparkesykler» is turned on in the board settings. The image above shows the Bolt logo where Bolt scooters are placed.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2021-09-02 at 14 27 23](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22789935/131843334-72492a7f-1524-459b-8761-06494f92b5f1.png)\r\n\r\n### Other additions: \r\n\r\n- Uploaded logos can now be deleted\r\n- Most `@entur/*` packages and a handfull external packages have been updated to their latest version in this release, which provides more stability and better security. \r\n- A local developer environment is now available for Firebase which allows for safer testing of Firebase functionality\r\n- Login now gives more general feedback, i.e. «Wrong username or password» instead of «Wrong password»\r\n\r\n### Fixes: \r\n- Divider line colors in dark theme have been corrected\r\n- Icon colors in light theme have been corrected\r\n- Warning about keys not being unique is «Kronologisk», «Tidslinje» and «Holdeplass» views have been fixed\r\n- `ValidateDomNesting` error in «Holdeplass» view has been fixed
## v5.7.0
# New View \"Holdeplass\" and Clustering of Scooters and Bikes\r\n\r\nThe new View (visning) named \"Holdeplass\" is suitable for showing one or few stop places. Situations will be written out in the third column, as you can see in the example below:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1909\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4339443/99395699-18936e80-28e1-11eb-97b9-4cd0b22bade6.png\">\r\n\r\nWe are now also clustering scooters and bike stations in the map, so that we don't show all the individual entities, but group them like this:\r\n<img width=\"456\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4339443/99396247-c9017280-28e1-11eb-8bf0-53aeb4e077ee.png\">\r\n\r\n
## v5.6.0
## Map View\r\n\r\nWe now have an entirely new view that brings the map to its full potential. It even displays walk times to the different stops. Check it out!\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4339443/95967763-e8057400-0e0c-11eb-84cb-1733ec0514c8.png)\r\n\r\n## Horizontal resizing\r\nIn the Compact view (Kompakt visning) you can now resize the boxes in the horizontal direction. Even more departures will be revealed if you expand the tiles.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4339443/95968419-b50fb000-0e0d-11eb-8a57-05d8611321fc.png)\r\n\r\n## Scooter view\r\n\r\nThe heading from the scooter tile is now removed, giving more room for the important stuff:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4339443/95968710-13d52980-0e0e-11eb-95c0-693d7a843094.png)\r\n

## v5.3.0
v5.3.0 is a big one 👀 \r\n\r\nThe biggest news this release is the addition of the endpoint `/tavler` which makes it easier for users to administer, share, and delete their boards. Additionally, Tavla has become even better on mobile screens! 📱\r\n\r\n* My boards\r\n    * You can now view all the boards you are an owner of.\r\n    * For each board, you can\r\n        * Change the board name.\r\n        * Share its link.\r\n        * Unlock it by setting yourself as a non-owner.\r\n        * Delete the board altogether.\r\n    * The page also makes it easier to create new boards and navigate to their admin panels.\r\n* UI\r\n    * Tavla on mobile screens will now look even better, especially on the admin panel!
## v5.2.0

## v5.0.0

## v4.2.0
- Updated 404 message for location without stops.\r\n- Icons for situations and cancellations are now shown for the relevant departures. For both chronological and compact view.\r\n- Some minor bug fixes.
## v4.1.0
This release increases support for older browsers.
## v4.0.0
We've released a new version of Tavla with draggable items!\r\nThe items are now rearrangeable and vertically resizable. \r\n\r\n![71672442-3d88fc80-2d76-11ea-8bce-cdb8b7f57fc3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1122305/71807259-27778680-306b-11ea-95ae-421342382f82.gif)\r\n\r\nThe position of the items on the board is stored to localStorage in the browser, and will not be persisted if the url is shared or in another browser. \r\n\r\nThis solves the issue https://github.com/entur/tavla/issues/123 
## v3.0.0
We have now released Tavla with the option to switch between different dashboards/designs (visningstyper). Check out our [blog post about this (in Norwegian)](https://medium.com/entur/tavla-med-nye-visningstypar-9b2e3ac2491d).\r\n\r\n_Dashboards_ are designs that might be radically different from other dashboards. They are completely independent of each other, but share the same data that comes from your own admin configurations.\r\n\r\nThe **Timeline** dashboard is a fun way to display departures, where the transport icons move toward their respective stop place. See the GIF below!\r\n\r\nWe encourage you to try and make your own creative dashboards. Check out [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/entur/tavla/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for a tutorial on how to do just that. If you haven't learned programming yet, but have an idea for a dashboard, please [tell us in an issue](https://github.com/entur/tavla/issues/new)!\r\n\r\n![timeline](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4339443/71174034-74362180-2264-11ea-8d37-5630f4d9d176.gif)\r\n
## v2
We have been working on Tavla lately and here's what's new 🎉 \r\n\r\n## Behavioral Changes\r\n\r\nWe use some other API calls behind the scenes now, especially for finding the nearest stop places within your specified radius. It is now based on walking distance. You might find that some stop places have disappeared, and maybe some new routes appear. It it likely that you would want to reconfigure your Tavla on the admin page.\r\n\r\n## New Feature\r\n\r\nYou can now add multiple columns for the same stop place and make individual filtering per duplicate. Say you want two columns for Jernbanetorget, one for trams and one for buses. Or maybe you want two columns for Brynseng, one for lines going towards the city center, one for those going the other direction.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4339443/66991982-5532dc00-f0c9-11e9-9060-92de929cf5fb.png)\r\n\r\n## Technical Changes\r\n\r\n### TypeScript\r\nUsing a static type system improves the developer experience by a ton. We now use TypeScript in this project.\r\n\r\n### Hooks\r\nAll class components and lifecycle methods are replaced with function components using hooks! 🎣 \r\nSome useful hooks we've made are the `useBikeRentalStations` and `useStopPlacesWithDepartures` that provide all the data needed for the dashboard view, based on the user's configuration.\r\n\r\n### Refactoring\r\nWe have done a bunch of refactoring and rewritten a lot in order to separate concerns and scope functionality better. We've created more \"dumb\" components and rewritten a lot of styles to follow BEM naming convention for scoping.
