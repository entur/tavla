"""
Purpose: Remove legacy 'override' field from footer objects in boards

Description:
    Removes the deprecated 'override' field from footer objects in all board documents. 
    The field was removed from frontend code but still exists as legacy data in the database.
    This is a cleanup migration since the field is no longer used anywhere in the codebase.

Usage:
    ./migration run scripts/004_remove_footer_override.py
